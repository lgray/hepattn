"""Batched linear assignment solved on whichever device the costs already live on.

A CLIC training step hands the matcher ~10k independent assignment problems at once (batch x
the decoder layers plus the final head), each at most a few hundred rows square. The host
solvers in :mod:`hepattn.models.matcher` need that whole stack copied device->host first, and
CPU-side parallelism over it saturates at ~16 threads. This module solves the same problems in
place on the GPU, so the copy and the host stall disappear. It is opt-in, through
``Matcher(device_solver="jv")``: on a GPU that is already saturated the solver's own kernels
cost more than the stall they remove, so it only pays when training is host-bound.

The solver is the batched Jonker-Volgenant of ``torch-linear-assignment`` (Crouse 2016, the
algorithm scipy itself uses), which is exact and strongly polynomial: its cost depends on the
shape of a problem and not on the values in it. An auction solver was tried first and dropped,
because the number of bidding rounds grows with the cost range and real matcher costs drove it
to non-convergence.

Costs are affine-normalised per problem before solving. This is exact -- every permutation
sums exactly ``n_rows`` entries, so ``(c - min) / range`` is a monotone map on total cost --
and it keeps the fp32 duals the solver works with well conditioned: the raw sentinel that
:class:`~hepattn.models.matcher.Matcher` uses for forbidden assignments on the host path
(``float32_max / 10``) would otherwise destroy them.

    """Solve a batch of rectangular linear assignment problems exactly, by Jonker-Volgenant.

    Every valid row is assigned a distinct column, minimising the total cost. There must be at
    least as many columns as rows in each problem, which the matcher guarantees because it only
    ever matches targets (rows) to a larger pool of queries (columns).

    Two preparation decisions carry the correctness of this path, and neither is obvious from
    the host solvers:

    * **Forbidden entries** go to ``num_rows + 1`` after the per-problem affine normalisation,
      and *not* to the ``float32_max / 10`` sentinel
      :meth:`~hepattn.models.matcher.Matcher._prepare_costs` hands the host solvers. A
      feasible assignment costs at most ``num_rows`` in normalised units, so ``num_rows + 1``
      is enough to make a forbidden pairing lose to every feasible one, and it keeps the fp32
      duals (``cost - u - v``) well conditioned where a 3.4e37 entry would destroy them.
    * **Padded rows** get a constant cost across every column. A batched solver assigns every
      row it is given, so padded rows cannot abstain. Constant rows contribute the same total
      whichever columns they take, so the solver parks them wherever suits the real rows and
      the optimum over the real rows is unchanged. This is the standard dummy-row reduction and
      it is exact -- padding with a large sentinel would not be, since the padded rows would
      then compete for the cheap columns.

    Args:
        costs: [batch, num_rows, num_cols] cost matrices. Non-finite entries are treated as
            forbidden assignments rather than propagating NaN.
