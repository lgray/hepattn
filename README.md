# hepattn

We present a general end-to-end ML approach for particle physics reconstruction by adapting cutting-edge object detection techniques.
Our work demonstrates that a single encoder-decoder transformer can solve many different reconstruction problems that traditionally required specialised, task-specific approaches.

Our method has been successfully applied to various reconstruction tasks and detector setups:

- **Pixel cluster splitting** - ATLAS [[PUB][tide]]
- **Hit filtering** - TrackML [[arXiv][trackml]], ITk [WIP]
- **Tracking** - TrackML [[arXiv][trackml]], ATLAS [[PUB][tide]]
- **Primary vertexing** - *Interested in working on this? Get in touch!*
- **Secondary vertexing** - Delphes [[EPJC][vertexing]]
- **Particle flow** - CLIC [[arXiv][glow]]
- **End-to-end reconstruction** - CLD [[ML4Jets][ml4jets]]
- **Muon Tracking** - ATLAS [[ConnectingTheDots][ctd]]

## 🛠️ Setup

First clone the repository:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:samvanstroud/hepattn.git
cd hepattn
```

We recommend using a container to set up and run the code.
This is necessary if your system's `libc` version is `<2.28`
due to requirements of recent `torch` versions.
We use `pixi`'s CUDA image, which you can access with:

```shell
apptainer pull pixi.sif docker://ghcr.io/prefix-dev/pixi:0.54.1-jammy-cuda-12.8.1
apptainer shell --nv pixi.sif
```

**📝 Note**: If you are not using the `pixi` container, you will need to make sure
`pixi` is installed according to https://pixi.sh/latest/installation/.

You can then install the project with locked dependencies:

```shell
pixi install --locked
```

**📝 Note**: The `default` environment targets GPU machines and installs FA2.
See the [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml) or [setup/isambard.md](setup/isambard.md)
for more information.

### The `lap1015` Extension

The `lap1015` linear assignment solver is a C++ extension vendored in
[`src/lap1015`](src/lap1015) and compiled from that source by `pixi install`. It
must be built from *this* repository's source, and not from an older or upstream
build, because only this version releases the GIL while solving. Without that, the
threaded matcher serialises: `Matcher(parallel_solver=True, n_jobs=16)` quietly runs
sixteen threads that all queue behind each other, and the CLIC default
`lap1015_late` solver ends up roughly 2x slower than `scipy`.

**Check your build in one line:**

```shell
pixi run python -c "import lap1015; print(lap1015.releases_gil)"
```

`True` is what you want. The flag is set at **compile** time, so it reports how the
binary was produced rather than how it behaves: an extension patched in place rather
than rebuilt reports `False` even if it does release the GIL, and either way the fix
is the same.

**To rebuild:**

```shell
pixi reinstall hepattn
```

This recompiles the extension from `src/lap1015/src/main.cpp`. A plain `pixi install`
will *not* do it if the environment already exists — pixi sees the package version
unchanged and skips it, which is how a build can sit stale across edits to the C++
source.

Two things guard this, and are worth knowing about if you change the build:

- `strict-config = false` in [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml) lets the build
  tolerate the `pixi-conda-environment` config-setting that pixi passes to the
  backend. Without it, scikit-build-core rejects the unknown option and
  `pixi install` fails outright on a fresh clone with
  `Unrecognized options in config-settings`.
- `tests/matching/test_solvers.py::test_lap1015_releases_gil` fails if the
  installed extension holds the GIL, so a stale build is caught by the test suite
  rather than by a warning nobody reads.

Note that scikit-build-core's `editable.rebuild = true` is *not* used, though it
looks like the obvious fix. Its import-time rebuild runs under the system `cmake`,
which cannot find the Python development headers, so it turns a stale extension
into an unimportable one. Rebuild explicitly instead.

### Optional: solving the matching on the GPU

By default the Hungarian matching runs on the host: the cost matrices are copied
device-to-host and solved across a thread pool. On a GPU that the model does not
saturate, the training step is host-bound and that copy plus solve dominates it.
For that case the `Matcher` has an opt-in device solver, an exact batched
Jonker-Volgenant (`torch-linear-assignment`) that solves in place on the GPU:

```yaml
matcher:
  class_path: hepattn.models.matcher.Matcher
  init_args:
    device_solver: jv
```

It is off by default and only worth turning on when training is host-bound. On a
GPU that is already busy the solver's own kernels cost more than the stall they
remove, so measure before adopting it. Its results are exact, as the host solvers'
are; the two are held to equal total assignment cost in
`tests/matching/test_device_solver.py`.

The backend is a CUDA extension that must be compiled against the environment's
torch, for the GPU it will run on, so it is not a pixi dependency. Build it with

```shell
pixi run bash setup/build_torch_linear_assignment.sh
```

and follow the instructions it prints (put the build on `PYTHONPATH`, with
`LD_LIBRARY_PATH` pointing at the environment's `lib`). The script sets the two
things that go wrong otherwise: `FORCE_CUDA=1`, without which a build on a
GPU-less login node silently produces a CPU-only extension, and
`TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST`, since there is no GPU there to detect. `Matcher` checks
for both failure modes at construction and refuses a missing or CPU-only build.
The script also patches the kernel's launch geometry for Blackwell GPUs: upstream
has no block-size entry for compute capability 10, so a B200 fell back to 128
threads per block and left almost half of its SMs idle during the solve. 32 was
measured fastest there, with identical assignments.

## 🌟 Activating the Environment

To run the installed environment, use:

```shell
pixi shell
```

Multiple environments are configured in `pyproject.toml` for different hardware setups and experiments (`default`, `cpu`, `isambard`, `clic`, `tide`, `ci`). Use `-e <env>` to specify a specific environment.

You can close the environment with `exit`.
See the [`pixi shell` docs](https://pixi.sh/latest/reference/cli/pixi/shell/) for more information.

## 🧪 Running Tests

Once inside the environment, if a GPU and relevant external data are available, just run:

```shell
pytest
```

To test parts of the code that don't require a GPU, run:

```shell
pytest -m 'not gpu'
```

To test parts of the code that don't require external input data, run:

```shell
pytest -m 'not requiresdata'
```

The current CI only tests the parts of the code that don't require a GPU or external input data:

```shell
pytest -m 'not gpu and not requiresdata'
```

**📝 Note**: If you encounter import errors for missing modules like `numba` when running tests in the `default` environment, switch to the appropriate experiment environment or use the `ci` environment which includes all required dependencies for tests (e.g. `pixi run -e ci pytest -m 'not gpu and not requiresdata'`).

## 📖 Terminology

To ensure clarity and consistency throughout this project, we use the following definitions:

- **constituent** - input entities that go into the encoder/decoder, e.g. inner detector hits
- **object** - reconstructed outputs from the decoder, e.g. reconstructed charged particle tracks
- **input** - (also `input_object`) generic term for any input to a module (could be constituents, objects, etc)
- **output** - generic term for any output from a module (could be objects, predictions, or intermediates)
